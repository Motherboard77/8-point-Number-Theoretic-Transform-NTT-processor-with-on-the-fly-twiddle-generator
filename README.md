# 8-point-Number-Theoretic-Transform-NTT-processor-with-on-the-fly-twiddle-generator
The Number Theoretic transform brings down the time complexity of polynomial multiplication of large intergers to quasi-linear complexity O(nlogn). In this pet project, we demonstrate the NTT transform of 8-point POLY with twiddle factors generated in real-time.
